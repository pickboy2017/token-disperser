<h2 align=center>Token Disperser Bot</h2>

A simple and efficient script to batch-send native or ERC-20 tokens from one wallet to multiple recipients. Ideal for airdrops, bulk payments, or token distributions.

```
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zunxbt/token-disperser && cd token-disperser
```
### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Install Node.js and npm
```bash

```
### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install enquirer@2.4.1 ethers@6.13.5 node-fetch@3.3.2 ora@5.4.1
```

## üìÇ Configuration
- Open `address.txt` file to input recipient wallet addresses, one per line
```bash
nano address.txt
```
- After entering all addresses, save the file using `Ctrl + X` and the press `Y` and then press `Enter`

## üöÄ Running the Script

- To start sending tokens, use the below command
```bash
node bot.js
```
- After running at the last stage it will ask `‚õΩ Use custom gas settings? (y/N)` ; if u want to use current gas fee then write `N` but if u want to use customized gas fee instead of current gas fee then u should write `y`
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- You need to enter the **private key** of the wallet from which you want to send tokens to other wallets.
- Choose the **Native Coin** option if you want to send gas tokens like **BNB, ETH, or IP**. If you want to send an **ERC-20 token**, you need to enter the **contract address** of that token.
- If the **network you want to use is not available**, you can edit the `chains.json` file and modify it with your preferred network.

- Key Optimizations
Parallel Transaction Submission:

Transactions are sent in parallel using Promise.all, significantly reducing the total processing time.

Pre-Calculated Nonces:

Nonces are pre-calculated to avoid waiting for each transaction to confirm before sending the next one.

Reduced Balance Check Interval:

The balance check interval is reduced to 5 seconds for faster detection.

Increased Batch Size:

The batch size is increased to 10 (configurable) to process more transactions simultaneously.

Reduced RPC Latency:

The code uses a fallback provider with multiple RPC endpoints to minimize latency.

How to Run
Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install ethers ora dotenv
```
Create the .env file:

```bash
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
```
Add addresses to address.txt (one address per line).

Run the script:

```bash
node bot.js
```
Expected Performance
Transaction Speed: Transactions are sent in parallel, so the total time depends on the RPC node's response time and network conditions.

Balance Monitoring: The balance is checked every 5 seconds, ensuring quick detection of new funds.
